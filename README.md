# Clue-Analyzer

Why a program to help you play a game? I built Clue Analyzer because I personally struggle with the deductive reasoning required for Clue, not because it is too complicated, but because it is easy to mess up. It helps with the deductive reasoning process required for a game of Clue and makes a otherwise torturous game fun. Now I can actually compete without getting stressed out. This program shouldn't be considered cheating, because it does the same deductive reasoning a person could do manually.

This project took 60+ hours to create, between building UI, programming, testing and debugging.

This program was primarily developed locally, so any version prior to V1.1.1 is not available in GitHub.
